Everything works! I was able to output stderr and stdout together or separately. I was able to fix the main so that is conforms to the specifications.

Question 1) The first recursive call to towers would be towers(4, 2, 1).
Question 2) Five recursive calls will be made to towers() before the first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation.
Question 3) Move #16 from Tower 2 to 3
Question 4) The second recursive call to towers would be towers(3, 2, 3).
Question 5) If towers(8, 2, 1) is invoked, 255 lines will be printed to stdout.
